`1.` Pains of Javascript  
    `1.1` Asynchronous Nature  
            Being able to control the program flow is fundamental to normative design decisions. Being able to predict the future or all alternative realities is not within the default toolkit of a typical programmer. Thus, when some failure occurs due to a challenge of syncronicity, it's easy to blame that on the mere fact that the language allowed it to be possible in the first place.  

`1.2` Loose Typing  
            With more degrees of freedom come more degrees of failure.  

`1.3` Web platform  
        By its very nature, web is diverse and ever-changing. Even now, the 'Browser Capatibility' chart on `mdn` is 11 columns wide, a challenge comparable to that of firmware design. The language most accomodate all different consumption angles, as it is nominally set to serve them all, a significant challenge even in much smaller scales.

`4` JavaScript frameworks  
`4.1` Why Vanilla JS in This Course  
            I respond to this question with a simple statement: designing a roller coaster in Roller Coaster Tycoon is designing a roller coaster in the Assembly. [Yes, really.](http://www.chrissawyergames.com/faq3.htm)

`4.2` Benefits of Vanilla Mastery  
            Knowing how a thing *actually works* can save untold years of rework, can dramatically cut down on overhead and bloat, and gives one the tools necessary to create gigalibraries from scratch.

`4.3` Cost of Framework Abstinence  
            Short team gains. There is almost always going to be a library or framework somewhere in the ether that does exactly what I'm trying to do. Abstinence turns a constant time lookup into a polynomial time learning process, and time... is money.  

`5` Lab Relation to Project  
    The project is a web application, and JavaScript is dominant client-side language of the web. Being familiar with its fundamental behaviors and client-side debugging is critical for a successful project.
